abstract="Smart contracts are programs, usually automating legal agreements such as financial transactions. Thus, bugs in smart contracts can lead to large financial losses. For example, an incorrectly initialized contract was the root cause of the Parity Wallet bug that made USD 280mil worth of Ether inaccessible. Ether is the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain that uses Solidity for expressing smart contracts.",
